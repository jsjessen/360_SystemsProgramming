            360 NOTES #3 Function Calls in C

Consider the program:

         main()
         { int a,b,c;
           a = 1; b = 2; c = 3;
           c = mysub(a,b);
           printf("c=%d\n", c); 
         }

         int mysub(int x, int y)
         {
           int u, v;
           u = 4; v = 5;
           return (x+y+u+v);
         }

The topics here are:
     -------------------------------------------------------
      Function call conventions in 32-bit C and stack usage.
     -------------------------------------------------------

**************************  NOTE !!! ************************************
      If you are running Linux on 64-bit machines, use
         gcc -m32 file.c 
      to generate 32-bit code. 
In 64-bit mode, which has more CPU registers, the GCC compiler generated code 
passes parameters in function calls SLIGHTLY differently! It passes the first 6 
parameters in CPU registers. It passes any additional parameters via the stack.
The following discussions apply only to 32-bit or lower code. 

The purpose here is to LEARN the principle of function calls and the stack usage
during execution. It does NOT matter whether it's 64-bit or 32-bit environment.
The principle is the SAME in any environment. 
************************************************************************

(1). When excuting a.out, a process image is created in memory, which looks 
     (logically) like the following:
   
     lowAddress                      HighAddress
          -----------------------------
          | Code | Data |  stack      |
          ----------------------------- 
(2). CPU registers:

     Every CPU has:

        PC register, which points to the next instruction
                     to be executed by the CPU.
        SP register, which points to the current top of 
                     the stack. (esp register)
        FP register, which points to the stack Frame of the
                     current active function (ebp register).
        A register for return value (eax register).

(3). Our main() is called by the C startup code, crt0.o. When crt0.o calls 
     main(), it pushes the return address (its current PC contents) onto stack,
     and enters main(). When main() is entered, the stack contains:

     HighAddress      ---------->              LowAddress
  
       --------------------------------------------- 
       XXXX|PC|
       --------------------------------------------- 
            ^ 
            SP 

     with SP pointing at the returnPC (where crt0.o called main().

(4). Upon entry, every C function does the following
     (4).1  push FP into stack;   this saves the FP register
     (4).2  let  FP point at the stack top, i.e. point at the saved FP.
     (4).3  shift SP downward to allocate space for local variables.
     (4).4  The COMPILER MAY shift sp farther down to allocate some temps
            on stack OR save some registers on stack.
   
     For this example, there are 3 local variables, a,b,c, each 4 bytes long. 
     The stack becomes:

     HighAddress      ---------->              LowAddress
                  a  b  c 
       --------------------------------------------- 
       XXXX|PC|FP|  |  |  |temps|
       --------------------------------------------- 
               ^               ^ 
               FP              SP 
               
(5). a=1; b=2; c=3;  The values 1,2,3 go to the locations of a,b,c, which are
     at -4, -8, -12 bytes from where FP is pointing at, respectively. 
     These are expressed as -4(FP), -8(FP), -12(FP) in assembly code.

(6). main() calls mysub() by  c = mysub(a,b);

     The compiled code for the function call consists of:

         PUSH parameters in reverse order:
              push b's value onto stack, push a's value onto stack,
         CALL mysub
              which pushes the current PC (contents) onto stack and replaces PC
              with the address of mysub, causing the CPU to enter mysub().
 
     When control just enters mysub(), the stack becomes

     HighAddress        ---------->            LowAddress
                  a  b  c 
       --------------------------------------------- 
       XXXX|PC|FP| 1| 2| 3|temps| 2| 1|PC|
       --------------------------------------------- 
                                       ^ 
                                       SP 

(7). mysub() is written in C.  Its actions are the same as those of main():
        push FP; 
        let FP point at the saved FP, and
        shift SP downward to allocate locals u,v.
        (sp may be shifted farther down for some temps on stack) 
     Then the stack becomes
         
     HighAddress           ---------->              LowAddress
                  a  b  c         y  x        u  v 
       -------------------------------------------------------- 
       XXXX|PC|FP| 1| 2| 3|temps| 2| 1|PC|FP|  |  |temps|
       -------------------------------------------------------- 
                                          ^            ^ 
                                |<------  FP ---->|    SP
                                stackFRAME of mysub 
(8). While in mysub(), 
 
               -----------------------------
               WHERE ARE x,y? WHERE ARE u,v?
               -----------------------------

     For this example, the parameters a, b are at 8(FP) and 12(FP), i.e. at 
     where FP points at + 8 bytes, + 12 bytes.  Local variables u, v are at 
     -4(FP) and -8(FP).

     The stack area visible to a function (parameters and locals) is called 
     the stack FRAME (like a frame of movie) of the function. Thus, FP is 
     called the stack FramePointer. As the above diagram shows,
              
               |parameters | retPC| savedFP| local variables |
                                      ^
                                      |
               |<=== params|=======  CPU.FP|=== locals =====>|
 
               |<-------- Stack Frame of Function ---------->|

(9). Return from called function:

     When mysub executes return (expression); it puts the value of the 
     expression in the return value register (eax for 486/Pentinum CPUs).
     Then, it deallocates the local variables by

       .copy FP into SP;   stack top now contains the saved FP.
       .pop stack into FP; this restores FP, leaving the return PC on top of 
                           the stack.
       .RET   RET pops the stack top into PC register, causing the CPU to 
              execute from the "return address" saved earlier.

(10). Upon return, the caller function copies the contents of the return value
      register into c, then it pops the parameters a,b off the stack (by adding
      8 to SP). This restores the stack to the same situation before the call.
  
      Then it continues to the next statement.

===========================================================================
NOTE: some C compilers allocate temp space and local variables as
         -----------------------------------------------------
          parms|retPC| FP |temps| locals
         --------------|----------------|---------------------  
                       FP               SP

in which the locals may NOT be directly below FP, but they are still at
             -offset(FP)
So the principle is the same.

Version 4 of gcc compiler allocates local variables in increasing address order.
      int a,b,c;          means address of a < address of b, etc.

      For the same C code shown above, the stack contents may look
      like the following:

     HighAddress            ------------->              LowAddress
                  c  b  a         y  x       v  u 
       -------------------------------------------------------- 
       XXXX|PC|FP| 3| 2| 1|temps| 2| 1|PC|FP| 5| 4|temps|
       -------------------------------------------------------- 
                                          ^            ^ 
                                |<------  FP ---->|    SP
                                stackFRAME of mysub 

     However, the concept and usage of the stack FRAME are the same for all
     compiled C code.
